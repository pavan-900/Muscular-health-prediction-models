# ðŸ’ª Muscular Health Prediction Models

This project implements machine learning models to assess and predict **muscular health risks**, including possible musculoskeletal disorders. It uses clinical or biomechanical datasets and applies supervised learning for early detection and personalized recommendations.

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Muscular health issues can significantly affect mobility and quality of life. With early prediction using measurable features (like age, posture, weight, etc.), health systems can provide timely support and prevent deterioration.
